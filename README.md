## Problem :
Extract the following elements from the 1st page of books.toscrape.com:
	- full book title
	- price as float
	- rating as int
Data should be stored as python list of dictionaries, where each book is dictionary
e.g. :

  {
    'title': 'Book title',
    'price': 420.69,
    'rating': 1
  }


## Use/Install/Test Solution:
1 - Clone the repository or download the reqs.txt file then Install the required Python packages using the following command:
<pre>
```
pip install -r reqs.txt
```
</pre>

2 - Clone the repository or download the solution.py file.
Run the script using the following command:
<pre>
```
python solution.py
```
</pre>

The script will output data for a randomly selected book from the first page of "bookstoscrape.com".
